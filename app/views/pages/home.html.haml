Hi, my name is Matthew. I am a recent computer science graduate and aspiring professional developer. Since my first experience with programming using my TI-83 calculatorâ€™s TI-BASIC programming solutions to write simple programs for my classmates, I have been aware of my aptitude for computer science and eventually decided to pursue it as a profession.
