<p><h2>Hi, my name is Matthew.</h2> I am an aspiring developer of elegant software solutions. I am a graduate of the computer science program at Southern Polytechnic State University. I have been developing software since I discovered the BASIC-based programming solutions on my TI-83 calculator in high school.</p>
<p>My first experience as an IT professional was also in high school when I worked with the IT maintenance team for the Oconee County School System. Most recently, I worked as a tutor for Southern Polytechnic State University’s School of Computing and Software Engineering.</p>
<p>I am comfortable working with new or unfamiliar languages and technologies. In fact, many of my most successful projects were the first I completed with a particular language or technology. For example, the Xrangs.com site was the first project I developed using Ruby and the Rails framework. Similarly, the real-time pricing simulation I developed was my first experience with both NVIDIA’s CUDA toolkit and GPGPU programming in general.</p>
<p>I am also an experienced team developer/contributor. I find that working closely with a skilled and motivated team can maximize the potential for any given project and provides a lasting benefit to all team members. Furthermore, since my first exposure to the  code management and version control tools incorporated in the VisualWorks Smalltalk IDE, I have been an adamant proponent for the use of code management tools in any group programming project.  A subset of the projects I have completed in teams can be viewed here, here, and here.</p>
